<i>Is there a Sex War?</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p>A feature of modern life is that
matrimonial quarrels, like modern war,
are carried on on a large scale, involving
not individuals, nor even small groups
of individuals, but both sexes and whole
classes of society. In the past, Jason
and Medea, neither of them quite
an exemplary character, measured their
strength against one another as individuals;
and, though each voiced the
wrongs and the naked brutality of their
sex, it did not occur to either to seek
in politics or in social reform a solution
or a compromise. Jason, indeed, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
reactionary face to face with a turbulent
and insurgent female, called to his aid
the powers of kingship and the State—to
suppress and exile, but not to remedy.
Medea, driven mad—like so many able
and remarkable women—by the contempt
and ingratitude of men as individuals or
in the mass, and aware that the law was
a mockery where she was concerned,
expressed herself in savage protest after
the manner of a militant suffragette.
While I can open my newspaper to-day
and read of mothers desperate with
hunger, misery, or rage drowning themselves
and their children, I cannot bring
myself to look upon Medea as some
elemental being from a dark and outrageous
past. As for Jason, he never did
appear to anybody as other than an
ordinary male.</p>

<p>During the last twenty or twenty-five
years, when women were struggling for
their right as citizens to a vote and to a
decent education, began what has been
called the sex war. No woman would
deny that we began it, in the sense that
we were rebels against a system of masculine
repression which had lasted almost
unbroken since the beginning of history.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
In a similar sense, the proletarian to-day
begins the class war. Those who remember
the heroic battles of suffrage days
know that the sequence of events was as
follows: We made our just demands and
were met with ridicule. We followed
with abuse—all the pent-up anger,
misery, and despair of centuries of
thwarted instinct and intelligence. Man
retaliated with rotten eggs. We replied
with smashed windows; he with prison
and torture. People forget so readily,
that it is well to remember that this was
in the immediate past; it is not a nightmare
picture of one of those future sex
wars with which our modern Jasons
delight to terrify the timorous of both
sexes.</p>

<p>Is there a sex war? There has been.
It was a disgraceful exhibition, and would
not have come to a truce so soon, but
that it was eclipsed by the still more
disgraceful exhibition of the European
War. In 1918 they bestowed the vote,
just as they dropped about a few Dames
and M.B.E.’s, as a reward for our services
in helping the destruction of our offspring.
Had we done it after the fashion of
Medea, the logical male would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
angry. They gave the vote to the older
women, who were deemed less rebellious.
Such is the discipline of patriotism and
marriage, as it is understood by most women,
that the mother will sacrifice her son
with a more resigned devotion than the
younger woman brings to the loss of her
lover. There may be more in this than
discipline. If honesty of thought, speech,
and action were made possible for women,
it might transpire that on the average a
woman’s love for her mate is more compelling
than love for her offspring. Maternal
instinct—genuine, not simulated—is
rarer, but, when found, more enduring.</p>

<p>There was a promise, as yet unredeemed
by any political party—for the politician
has yet to be found who will realize that
the sex problem is as fundamental in
politics as the class war, and more fundamental
than foreign trade and imperial
expansion—to extend this franchise on
equal terms with men. “Good fellowship”
between the sexes as between classes
was the key-note of the war. It was held
that women had proved their mettle and
that mutual aid was to be the basis of all
future activities, public and private. The
sex question was deemed settled, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
everyone was led to suppose that all inequalities
would be gradually eliminated.
On this partial victory and this promise
feminists called a truce, and abandoned
the tactics of militarism.</p>

<p>But you never know where you have
Jason. He was a soldier, mark you, and
a gentleman. Forbidden open warfare,
he takes to sniping. He snipes the
married women out of those posts for
which they are peculiarly fitted—as teachers
or maternity doctors—although it is
against the law to bar women from any
public activity on the ground of marriage.
He cheats unemployed women out of
their unemployment insurance more craftily
and brutally than he cheats his
fellow-men. Instead of realizing that the
competition of women in industry and
the professions is a competition of population
pressure rather than of sex, he
seeks by every means in his power to
drive woman back to matrimonial dependence
and an existence on less than half a
miserably inadequate income; and then
he mocks at her when she claims the right
to stem the inevitable torrent of children
whose advent will but aggravate man’s
difficulties as well as her own. But worse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
than all the sniping is the smoke-screen
of propaganda. While feminists have,
in a large measure, stayed their hand,
anybody who has anything abusive to
say of women, whether ancient or modern,
can command a vast public in the popular
press and a ready agreement from the
average publisher.</p>

<p>It is a very insidious propaganda. Thus
the fashion-papers tell us that grandmamma’s
ways are coming back into
their own; elsewhere we are flattered
for the frank honesty of the modern girl
and then warned not to ask for equal
pay or opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Again, we hear that
woman, like the Labour Party when in
office, has done nothing with the opportunities
given her by the vote; or that the
country rejected the women candidates
wholesale. This, regardless of the fact
that the steady increase of the Labour poll
has been due in great part to the votes
and more to the organization and propaganda
of large numbers of intelligent
working women who know not only what
they want, but how to get it. They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
backed now by many of the middle-class
women who were young enough to be
revolted by war politics in 1914, and are
old enough to claim their citizenship in
1924. Hundreds of thousands of others,
now between twenty and thirty, mothers,
professional and working women, will
make themselves heard before long. To
them, the principle of feminine equality is
as natural as drawing breath—they are
neither oppressed by tradition nor worn
by rebellion. I venture to think that, had
the Labour Party machine been less dominated
by the masculine perspective, to
which the equal franchise bill was a matter
of secondary importance, they would
not have lost so heavily in the 1924
election. Votes for women at 21 would
have greatly increased the poll of many
Labour candidates. I have seen young
mothers almost sobbing outside the polling-station
on polling-day because they
had no vote to cast for the future of
themselves and their children. As for the
defeat of women candidates, everybody,
including the leader-writers who spread
the adverse propaganda, knew perfectly
well that the majority of them stood in
constituencies where even a man of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
party would not have had the ghost of
a chance. Here again Jason at headquarters
displayed his well-known chivalry.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Sunday Pictorial</cite>, January 4, 1925.</p>

</div>

<p>It is no part of my thesis to maintain
that women display their feminism in
proportion as they vote for any particular
political party—Labour, for example. But
I do suggest that it is the progressive
working woman rather than the woman
of the middle class who will in the future
make the most important contribution to
the thought of feminism and to a solution
of our practical difficulties. One
of the most inveterate anti-feminists, the
author of <cite>Lysistrata</cite>, as an avowed anti-democrat,
has based his thesis and his
strictures on observations that do not go
beyond the bounds of upper- and middle-class
people, barely even beyond the
bounds of the night club or the suburban
dance-hall. In his eyes we are to blame
for everything. Our worst crime is to
“blaspheme life and man”; our next,
not to have prevented food being put
into tins; our next, to have adhered
faithfully to that ascetic view of life and
sex so firmly instilled into us by medieval
monks and bullying Puritan fathers and
brothers. We are to blame for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
industrial revolution in that we let
weaving, spinning, milling, and baking
go out of our hands. We are to blame
for the iniquities of doctors in that we
did not maintain our position as the
dispensers of healing potions and simples.
We are to blame in that we have not
learned to bring forth our children without
pain, those children whose brows bear
the marks of obstetric instruments that
were used to spare their mothers, and
whose lips have not been laid to those
inhuman mothers’ breasts. (There are
no scars of war, O Jason!) Where is
salvation for us, and how shall we rid
us of the burden of our iniquity? We
who have waxed so arrogant that we have
even aspired to let science build our
children outside their mothers’ bodies
must humble ourselves once more and
take upon us the whole duty of woman.
We must use our votes to restore aristocracy<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and take the food out of tins;
spin and weave, no doubt, the while we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
nurse and bear our yearly child, delivering
it over to infanticide when necessary,
since birth-control is artificial and displeasing
to the male. In our leisure
moments—of which, doubtless, we shall
find many under this humane <em>régime</em>—we
are to discover by what means of diet,
or exercise it may be, we can fulfil our
maternal functions with pleasure instead
of suffering.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> An ingenious method of accomplishing this
suggests itself. Since women do not sit in the
House of Lords, suppose that all Peers’ wives,
following the example of the Duchess of Atholl,
stand for Parliament where their husbands
have estates. This would obviate the necessity,
now felt by Conservatives, of restoring the veto
of the House of Lords.</p>

</div>

<p>A joke, you say? No, no, my poor
Medea, it is a man called Rousseau, risen
from the dead. Not long ago he preached
this sort of thing to women who pinched
their waists and wore a dozen petticoats.
They were not educated enough to follow
Voltaire, so they listened to what Rousseau
called the Voice of Nature. Soon
thereafter, they found they were being
abused for being less civilized, more ape-like
than the male, irrational and unsuited
to take a part in public life. So they tried
again, poor things, and then there was
an awful thing called the Industrial Revolution,
and the food got into tins. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
may be pardoned, as may all of us, if
at this point they became a little bewildered.
Some people blamed science, some
civilization, some the meat-trusts and the
millers, but the true culprit, as ever,
was Woman. A thousand voices cried
her down—she hadn’t enough children;
she had too many; she was an ape;
she was a dressed-up doll; she was a
Puritan; she was an immoral minx;
she was uneducated; they had taught
her too much. Her pinched waist was
formerly abused—now it was her slim
and boyish body. Eminent surgeons<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
committed themselves to the view that
the boyish figure with its pliable rubber
bust-bodices and corselets would be the
ruin of the race, that race which had
been superbly undegenerate through four
centuries of armour-plate corset and eighteen-inch
waists, that race which, then
or now, can hardly compete in toughness
with the Chinese, among whom the
boyish figure has been for centuries the
ideal, and whose women cannot conceivably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
be accused of shirking any of the
responsibilities of maternity. Others told
us that the woman-doctor has no nerve
to tend confinements, and conveniently
forgot that, since the world began, and
until quite modern times, it is women
who have ministered to one another in
that agony which now as in the past
is the lot of every mother. Is there
truth in the words of Jason? Is there
truth or justice in the passion of Medea?
Let us not ask the protagonists, but
let us summon the inquiring intelligence
of Hypatia to find us a way out of the
intolerable tangle in which their quarrelling
has landed us.</p>

<i>The Early Struggles of Feminism</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the feminist struggle began during
the last century, ignorance and beauty
were the two qualities most admired in
women. It is necessary to remind our
masculine critics what was the soil from
which the feminist movement sprang and
what the current morality which influenced
its direction. It was customary in those
days to make fun of old or ugly women
and to scorn those who showed any signs
of intelligence. A man chose a young,
beautiful, and blushing creature for his
bride, and transformed her by one year
of marriage and one childbirth into a
gentle and submissive matron. Ugly or
intelligent women, for the most part,
paid a heavy price. Not only were they
rejected in youth, and starved of all their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
natural joys, but as “old maids” they
were the object of general scorn and
derision. Small wonder that women
adopted artificial aids to beauty and artificial
hindrances to their native intelligence.
Strongest of all the taboos laid
by masculine custom and religion on feminine
minds was that regarding sex-knowledge.
Their purity was to be preserved
only by ignorance, and even as
matrons and mothers it was scarcely
decent for them to refer to any of the
physical changes of their bodies. It is
impossible to over-estimate the strength
of this tradition, or the harm which has
been worked by it to the cause of women.</p>

<p>The feminists were, and are still,
howled down by men on the pretence that
they invented chastity and scorn of bodily
values. History disproves such a
ridiculous assertion. The early feminists
were what history and tradition made
them, and could not at the time of their
rebellion have been otherwise. The origin
of the stupid ideal of womanhood against
which men as well as women to-day
are still fighting was the asceticism of
the Christian religion; and, unless St.
Paul was a woman in disguise, I fail to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
see how woman is to be blamed for a
conception of her place and duty from
which she has suffered more than anybody
else. Before the conversion of the West
to Christianity, barbarian women of the
North enjoyed a certain rough equality
with their husbands. They stride through
the sagas, these fierce women, brides of
heroes, glad to reward the warrior with
their favours, quick to avenge an insult
or a wrong. They had no need to stoop
to cajolery. Savage and untamed, they
were the fit and equal mates of savage
men.</p>

<p>Then came the monks, and the white
wimples and courtly dresses and chivalry,
chants and cathedrals, and meek and
reverent casting up and casting down of
eyes. The savage breast that had swelled
and throbbed untrammelled in love or
anger learnt to flutter and to sigh.
Quenched were the fires of Brunhilde, her
sunlit rock deserted. Agnes and Mary,
tamed and pious, sat cooing in the shade.
But for meekness and maternity, the early
days of asceticism might have seen a
crusade to destroy that temptress—woman.
Barely allowed a soul, she
slipped through a life of oblivion, praying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
that it might be a pretty crown with
which Heaven would reward her patience
and submission at the last. Then came
the Puritans and denied her even that,
substituting ugliness in this life as well as
the negation of body, and a heaven of
people in starched nightshirts, rendered
oblivious to the horrid spectacle of their
figures by the still more horrid chanting
of their nasal psalms.</p>

<p>A breath of rationalism—brief, soon
choked, a breath of “nature”—and so
to crinolines, pantalettes, and a life still
lived in terror of hell-fire, terror of parents,
dread of husband, horror of the least
breath of adverse public opinion. Anyone
who reads the <cite>Fairchild Family</cite> must
marvel that from such nerve-destroying
parental tyranny and the intolerable weight
of prejudice and religious superstition the
nineteenth-century woman ever found the
courage to rebel.</p>

<p>Was it astonishing that the revolt had
in it something frenzied and ascetic—that
it seemed to express the anger of
the spinster thwarted and despised in the
current schemes of values? I do not
think the pioneers were so much Puritan
as votaries, hanging the tablet of each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
achievement in the temple of Athene
or of Artemis, pressing on, breathless,
swift of foot, sure of aim, in dread of
the fate of Atalanta whom the Golden
Apples lured to destruction and the marital
embrace. “Chaste as the icicle, that
hangs on Dian’s temple.” They had need
to be, perhaps, who, in an atmosphere of
swoons and ringlets, won for us schools
and colleges, free limbs, health and the
open air; unlocked for us the classics,
science, medicine, the history of our
world; drew us from our paltry, ladylike
accomplishments; wrote upon our school-books:
“Knowledge is now no more a
fountain sealed,” and flung wide the gate
into the world.</p>

<p>They, these pioneers, childless, unwed,
created and bore thousands of women,
made them anew, body and soul, for lives
of mental and physical activity unknown
in the past to any but the very exceptional
few. Just like the new learning of the
Renaissance to men’s minds in Europe
was the opening of high school and university
to the feminine mind of to-day.
Thousands of women of the last generation
and this, who would otherwise have
passed their existence in genteel poverty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
and vacancy of mind, have found their
happiness in teaching, in medicine, or in
some other profession. Thousands of
mothers have watched with delight the
unfolding of their children’s minds, and
enjoyed co-operating over “lessons” and
arguing politics with the adolescent.</p>

<p>We, who in a sense are the children of
the feminist pioneers, whose thoughts embrace
the universe, whose lives are one
long round of mental and physical delight,
at times intense to ecstasy—we at least
will pay our tribute to those who lit
the sacred fires, before we take up pen
and paper to criticize.</p>

<p>When one reads the lamentations of
would-be intelligent men about the iniquities
of modern young people, chiefly
those of the female sex, one cannot but
laugh at their method of approach. It
would seem according to them that our
modern women just happened like that:
no one had a part in forming their bodies
or in training their minds. In so far
as these people consider education or
early training at all, it is to blaspheme at
the sex-hating feminists who have trained
modern women to dispense with their
birth-right—the love of man. How this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
squares with the wail of the Bishops
against the sexual immorality of the
younger generation we will leave Jason
or the eloquent author of <cite>Lysistrata</cite> to
decide. Our business is not to condemn
woman, past or present, but to chronicle
faithfully the forces that have made her,
and the aspirations which will mould her
future. For she, and she alone, shall be
the arbiter of her fate, and neither man
nor creed stand between her and the
realization of her ideals. Men have blasphemed
woman and life too long, and
it will not be until the issues are clearer,
the battle more advanced, that the basis
for co-operation between man and woman
can be finally established. There is too
much evidence at present that man, professing
friendship and concern, is still
ready to snatch from us what little we
have won.</p>

<p>To those elderly gentlemen, then, who
watch with horror the upper- and middle-class
woman perpetrating similar follies
to those of upper- and middle-class men,
the first question we would put is:
“What education did they give their
daughters, and what was taught to their
mothers before them? What were the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
current ideas about feminine destiny which
encircled them in their impressionable
years?” Many would answer, still far
too many, that their daughters were given
the education of a gentlewoman and
fitted to become the wives of gentlemen.
This we know of old. The lady eats,
drinks, digests, wears clothes, tinkles the
piano, dances, sings, handles a golf-club,
submits to sex, bears a child without
the smallest notion of anatomy, turns
from the whole thing disgusted, and probably
bears no more. Whose fault? Not
hers. They do not teach mothercraft or
physiology in finishing schools for gentlemen’s
daughters, and it is no part of
the duty of gentlemen’s wives to reproduce
their kind. Perhaps there is comfort
in that.</p>

<p>A great many parents, however, would
tell us that they gave their daughters a
good and liberal education in such schools
as were available, good ordinary boarding- and
day-schools which have sprung up
during the last fifty years in response to
the feminist propaganda. Then we have
the working woman, who has shared with
her brothers in what education is permitted
to trickle through the elementary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
schools. It must not be forgotten that
this ends at fourteen.</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with this
education of women, and if so, what?
I think we must judge that there is. The
reason lies in the sense of inferiority bred
in women by so much oppression, and the
natural result that their chief aim as they
struggled upwards was to prove that in
all respects they were just as good as
men. The second aim was to prove that
they could jolly well do without them.
In exactly the same way the worker,
rising in the social scale, seeks to prove
himself a <em>bourgeois</em>. Both efforts are
mistaken. Each class and sex has that
to give to the common stock of achievement,
knowledge, thought, which it alone
can give, and robs itself and the community
by inferior imitation. The feminist
movement, like one dissentient voice
in an excited public meeting, was querulous,
hysterical, uncertain of itself. It
dared not cry out that women had bodies.
Its one hope of success was to prove that
women had minds. And it was right in
this, that the primary fact about men and
women is not that they are two sexes
apart, but that they are human beings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
as such should share all knowledge in the
world and make it the basis of their partnership
and the rearing of their children.</p>

<p>Many an ardent feminist spinster in a
girls’ secondary school has sighed over
the state of public opinion which forced
her to drive her girls’ minds along channels
for which they were not always
suited, that they might do well at college
and show that women could surpass the
men. Many another, well drilled by a
mother or tradition in ideals of feminine
virtue, gloried in the sexless learned women
she was creating and in the thought
that one day they would force those
savage, lustful men to conform to the
ideals which they set up for women.
Why blame her? Lay the blame where it
is due. It will be but a just retribution
for that lustful male and his ideal of
feminine virtue if one day, in a world
full of prohibitions, he finds himself
forced to kneel before the Mumbo-Jumbo<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
he himself built up to terrify
his wives and daughters to submission.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Mumbo-Jumbo was an idol set up by the
men in Nigeria to terrify erring women. The
men, but not the women, knew him to be a fake.
See <cite>Mungo Park’s Travels</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Feminist ideals of education, then, had
the defect that they did in a certain
measure deny sex, or ignore it. The
feminists had a pathetic hope that by
so doing they would convince the dominant
male that a woman might be learned
and yet remain a lady. But I wish to
emphasize the fact that this feature has
belonged to all education of women,
especially of ladies, from time immemorial,
and it is, therefore, unbecoming in a
male, whether young or old, to use this as
a cause for reproach to our sex. We went
as far as we dared with an eye to male
hostility. Young feminists to-day would
be the first to admit that it would probably
have paid us to go further. There
never has been a period when education
has trained women for the possibility of
motherhood, and it is time that such
training was begun. There never was
a period when the education of women
was completely honest, and it is time
that that training was begun. What
knowledge is of more vital importance to
women than anatomy and physiology?
They were allowed it if they were to be
doctors, and then only with caution.
Turning casually the pages of a book on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
anatomy in a girls’ secondary school
library, I found the diagrams connected
with sex and maternity carefully stuck
fast. What is more calculated to inspire
prying and prurience? We have no right
to blame young women for shirking marriage,
sex, or motherhood, or for moulding
their figures on boyish lines, when
we carefully treat them as boys and
withhold from them as long as we can
all knowledge of the difference of their
physique and possibly of their destiny.
I have no wish to go back on the great
achievements of feminism, or to drive
women from the professions in which
they have a just right to be employed.
I want to break down the last barriers.
Artemis is slim and bold; Athene is
stately. We have done well to worship
at their shrines.</p>

<p>But the call of Demeter the Fruitful is
insistent. If we would add to the
achievements of those who came before
us, let us freely admit that we have but
been playing mock modesty, and that to
us the body is no mere box to hold the
mind, but a temple of delight and ecstasy:
a temple to hold the future if we will.
To me the important task of modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
feminism is to accept and proclaim sex;
to bury for ever the lie that has too long
corrupted our society—the lie that the
body is a hindrance to the mind, and sex
a necessary evil to be endured for the
perpetuation of our race. To understand
sex—to bring to it dignity and beauty
and knowledge born of science, in place
of brute instinct and squalor—that is the
bridge that will span the breach between
Jason and Medea.</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Aspasia</span><br>
<i>The Younger Feminists</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p>While we have admitted that the first
aim of the feminist movement was to
open to women the stores of learning, to
develop their minds and to teach them to
think, and that no attempt was made to
handle the problem of sex, it is not quite
fair to say that even early feminism has
consistently denied or despised the body.
The schools and colleges made it their
business to give to women opportunities
for physical development, for open-air
exercise, swimming, tennis, hockey, lacrosse.
The Victorian young woman
learnt gradually to be ashamed of her
tiny waist and fat hips. She learnt that
a healthy appetite<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as well became a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
young woman as a young man, gave up
her snacks in private and did justice to
good meals taken at proper intervals.
Quietly, and without mention of the
fatal word “sex,” the spinster feminists,
by emphasis on health and vigour, built
up a generation of young women who
were to be frank about other desires besides
eating and drinking.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> There may be a biological cause of the
alleged smallness of feminine appetite. Watching
a raven and his consort with fresh meat, I
observed that she obtained only a minute portion
beneath the contempt of the male. Can
it be that, in the savage state, only those females
survived who could exist on the little the male
allowed them? Is this a case of sex-linked
heredity?</p>

</div>

<p>I cannot see what is the matter with
our figures. Steel rods and rubber are
more modern materials than oak beams
and pink plaster. Neither we nor
our modern lovers admire the opulent
Venuses, indolent and rose-embowered,
who adorned the ceilings of old-fashioned
ballrooms. They were stupid, self-indulgent
creatures, not even good mothers,
whatever the sentimental elderly gentlemen
in their top-hats and whiskers may
have to say. What is a good mother
we will discuss in a later chapter,
but for the present it is enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
say that more dangerous childbirths are
due to narrow pelves caused by rickets
than to hips contracted by the corsets
of vanity. Let the doctors turn socialist
and feed the poor, instead of spending
their time lamenting the inadequacy
for childbirth of a few fashionable
women who don’t very much matter.
Middle- and upper-class girls nowadays—and
most working-class girls, too—go
corsetless up to maturity. They do gymnastic
exercises, and dances that give
suppleness to the body. They swim and
they play out of doors. Those who are
rich enough to be adequately fed are
graceful and active as kittens, and as
healthy. By the time adolescence brings,
as it always does, a few years of intensive
sex-vanity, the corset can do very little
harm. The muscular little body does
not tolerate it stiff, or very tight, and
the bones are well grown. The mystery
of feminine dress helps the appearance
of slimness. There are few clothes, and
no lumpy gathers. Beneath that boyish
outline are firm little breasts, clean arching
hips, abdominal curves and thighs,
lovely as anything the Venus of Milo
has to show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Artemis fashioned this modern woman.
That is admitted. Has Artemis her
vows?</p>

<p>I’m afraid for once we have to admit
that the Bishops are right. In spite of
everything the Church can do, in spite of
an education committed, so far as the
authorities can control it, to sour or
religious spinsters, the modern young
woman is not very moral. It is a
pathetic picture which the author of
<cite>Lysistrata</cite> has drawn for us, of sexless
beings going to and fro in tube and bus-like
shuttles in a machine to dull work
robbed of all joy, earning their livelihood
and turning their backs on man in response
to feminist propaganda. Man, the
enemy—to be defeated in his own professions,
to be repelled in every onslaught
upon feminine virtue: I wonder? I
would hazard a guess that, relatively to
the population, fewer women retain their
virginity till death than in the Victorian
period or the Middle Ages. In all probability
it is sex, not sexlessness, which
makes women cling so tenaciously to the
right to earn their living. Marriage
brings a jealous intolerant husband, children,
prying and impertinent neighbours—degraded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and humiliating slavery for
the vast majority of women. Thirty
shillings a week and typing or working in
a shop, a still tongue, or a toss of the
head and the assertion that independence
is the best; and, in the background a
lover with whom somehow evenings are
spent—a lover who has no claim and cannot
tyrannize. A lover, perhaps, who
pleads to become a husband, but has no
chance unless his income is good or secure.
Marriage would change him: Aspasia knows
it. Marriage would also rob her of that
thirty shillings a week, which alone stands
between her and the abyss of primeval
submission. Or else Aspasia teaches in a
school or college. She is a skilled teacher,
devoted to her work and pupils. She may
be a Research Fellow in some difficult
branch of learning which is to her the
very breath of life. She may be a doctor
in the public service, tending and advising
mothers and children. She is lovely, vital,
creative. Man approaches. There are
holidays of delight and secret dread of the
scandal which will end the work Aspasia
loves—or marriage and the certainty of
that end at once. “Choose,” say the
Bishops and the school-managers (often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the same thing): “Choose,” say the public
authorities who support the Church and
rather wish women would get out of this
indelicate profession of surgery and medicine;
“choose between love and duty to
the male and service to the community.”
This is not feminism—feminists have
fought it persistently—it is medieval Christianity.
It presents a choice between
physical pleasure and service to the mind
or soul; it upholds the time-honoured
theory that renunciation of the world, the
flesh, and the devil is the path to duty and
salvation. I am fully aware of all the
arguments about economic pressure, the
primary right of married men to work,
the awful situation of their dependent
children and their wives. None of this is
fundamental, and the jealous male knows
it. “Divide to conquer” is the principle
in dealing with trade unions; it works
equally well in the feminist struggle. Persuade
the single women that the married
woman is an unfair competitor,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> terrify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
them so far as you can into believing that
to succumb to sex is something unbecoming
and disgraceful and punishable with
misery everlasting, whether in marriage or
outside of it, and you can prevent the
women combining against you.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> This scheme no longer works, as is evidenced
by the attitude of the National Union of Women
Teachers this year (1925). Intelligent women
are more appreciated than they were, and teachers
know they may all want to marry some day.</p>

</div>

<p>But not if Aspasia will speak. If she
but would, and put an end to this lie for
ever. She could tell us how, especially
during the years of war, young women
took the last step towards feminine emancipation
by admitting to themselves and
their lovers the mutual nature of sex-love
between man and woman. It sounds
a platitude, but is, in fact, a revolution.
Strange to say, the nearness of death
from enemy bombs or enemy fire did not
intensify the thought of holiness and
heaven. It made the little footrules to
measure morality look absurd; it mocked
the emptiness of female virtue. While
poverty and parents forbade the certainty
of marriage, with nothing but instability
and death around them, our modern
Aspasias took the love of man and
gave the love of woman, and found this
union, free and full on either side, the
most priceless gift the immortal gods
can bestow. There is nothing new in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
this, the moralist will say—it is just
wickedness. Yes, there is this that is
new: that, though these younger women
may be driven from fear of starvation
to the outward acceptance of old codes
and conventions, inwardly they know they
have done no wrong and will not admit
a conviction of sin. Sex, even without
children and without marriage, is to
them a thing of dignity, beauty, and
delight. All Puritans—and most males
so long as they can remember—have tried
to persuade women that their part in
sex is pregnancy and childbirth, and not
momentary delight. As well tell a man
his part is the hunting and skinning of
animals for food and clothing. To enjoy
and admit we enjoy, without terror or
regret, is an achievement in honesty. We
will go further and say that polygamy,
proffered by the male as a solution to
our sexless lives, is no solution at all
when we are polyandrous. It is useless
to go on pretending, as both sexes do,
about this question. The plain truth is
that there are as many types of lover
among women of all classes as among
men, and that nothing but honesty and
freedom will make instinctive satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
possible for all. Grant each man and
woman the right to seek his or her own
solution without fear of public censure.
Moral questions of this kind cannot be
decided by some abstract rule. It would
not be wrong for a man to have six wives,
provided he and they all found mutual
happiness in that arrangement; nor for
a woman to have six husbands and a
child by each, if she and they found such
a life satisfactory. The wrong lies in
rules that are barriers between human
beings who would otherwise reach a fuller
and more intense understanding of one
another. And any man or woman of
intelligence and vitality can testify that
to have known each other as lovers is to
have completed mental and spiritual, as
well as physical, understanding, and to
have permanently enriched each other’s
lives, capacities, energies, imaginations.
There is no need to make these divisions
into mind and body. There is no difference.
A way of walking, laughter,
thoughts spoken or written, gestures of
love or anger, colour and light of eyes
or hair—these are the human being, man
or woman. It is thus that modern individuals
think of one another. When we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
think so, it seems absurd to argue whether
or no love between man and woman
should stop short of a certain kind of
physical expression. It is useless to say
that a mental exchange is sufficient. On
the contrary, lovers know that it is
through sexual understanding they best
apprehend the quality of each other’s
minds. It is equally futile to argue that
woman is cheated of her full rights if
children do not result. That is not true.</p>

<p>It is said that modern human beings,
by dint of not valuing the body, are physically
degenerate and lose the finest
ecstasies of love. Their digestions are
poor, we are told, their breath foul, their
teeth bad. Was love more delightful,
then, in the old days when baths were
unknown, when “sweet breath” in a
woman was so rare as to be sung by
poets, and the reek of stale sweat was
barely stifled by a strong perfume? John
Donne wrote verses to the flea he saw
nestling in his lady’s bosom. There is
scarcely a fine gentleman to-day who
could face the prospect of making love
to one of the fine ladies of the past six
or seven hundred years in Europe, if
she could be presented to him just as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
was to her contemporary lovers. It is
true that neither vermin, filth, nor squalor—being
equal for both—can stay the
passion of sex whether now or in the
past, but I do not believe in the theory
that the rougher our physique the more
intense our bodily delights. Health, to
be sure, is essential; but health is to be
secured in the modern world, not by a
return to savagery, but by the use of
intelligence. I believe the bodies of young
people of to-day to whom fair opportunities
have been given are more healthy
within and without than they were in
past times. And I believe that the disappearance
of religious and moral dualism
between mind and matter—not by an
oppressive victory of either, neither by
rational and moral control, nor by abandonment
to sensual materialism, but by
a better understanding of psychology and
physiology based on the discoveries of
physical science—is bringing to the whole
of life, but especially to sex-love, maternity,
the rearing and education of children,
joy and rapture and promise surpassing
anything known to the purely
instinctive life of the past. Of course
we are bewildered. Civilization without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
decay is at last a possibility. Let us
have knowledge and patience: blaspheming
and violence will ruin all.</p>

<p>It is for modern women and for men
who can understand the problem to
make an end to secrecy, shame, and
starvation where sex is concerned. There
has been a good deal of freedom in action,
but less boldness in speech, because of
the heavy penalties involved. For some
women speech is impossible; those who
are secure must fight their battle. How
old and proper people love a vigorous
and god-like young male! How they
look askance upon, brow-beat, and bully
his equivalent in the opposite sex! Here
is a community for ever starving and
choking its finest women, stifling their
voices in education and public life; then
turning and rending the submissive residue
for being what years of intimidation
have made them. Let them marry, you
say, and make a success of that and
their children. That would be well
enough but for the taboos and disabilities
with which marriage is surrounded.
Feminism led women away from the
home that they might return armed and
unsubdued to make marriage tolerable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Women who have been free remember
the horror of the approach to marriage:
a barrier for most of us to free public
activity; a life-long contract only to be
broken in disgrace and public disgust;
aunts, uncles, social duties that exasperate
and are totally unnecessary; the common
view that henceforward husband and wife
are one and indivisible, and the wife for
ever to be burdened with her husband’s
duties and affairs; looks of surprise and
reproach if we enjoy other male society;
constraint in the manner of men formerly
our friends; income, if we have any or
can still earn, taxed as a part of our
husband’s; children, which, had we had
them illegitimate, would have been our
own but now are our husband’s; worst
of all, the looks and smiles from silly
women broken in to slavery, congratulating
us on having done well and made
ourselves secure for life.</p>

<p>Let no one think this is petulant abuse.
It is the accumulation of these details,
and the pressure of public opinion which
gradually destroy the nerve and independent
judgment of married women
who, in their free state, have been brilliant
and remarkable. It is the fact that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
by marriage, we conform and place
ourselves in a line with millions of others
whose view of what we have done is
entirely foreign to our own. As a Labour
Minister is corrupted by Court dress,
so is a free woman by the marriage-contract.
Nothing but our desire for
children would make us endure it. We,
to whom the mutual nature of sex-love
is sacred, to whom a partnership involving
children is of equal dignity on both
sides, to whom the surrender of our
whole being in love is a free gift—the
highest we can bestow; who would neither
bind ourselves nor others where love is
non-existent; we must submit to a contract
based on rights of property and
possession, buying and selling of our
bodies; a law whose conception of conjugal
wrongs is sin, punishment, and just
revenge; and a Church whose utmost
concession is to bid us “serve” instead
of “obey” our husbands. Build, O
Aspasia, a trade union of lovers to conquer
the world, and cry aloud that
feminism is nowhere so much needed
as in the home.</p>

<i>Feminist Mothers</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p>So far I have refrained from any detailed
discussion of modern women and maternity
because it is still necessary to make
it clear that a full life of activity for
women is perfectly possible and permissible
without it. I am quite aware that
certain religious people assert as a moral
principle that the purpose of sex-love is
not mutual enjoyment but the perpetuation
of the race. I am also aware that
militarists enjoin on women the necessity
of marriage and large families as a patriotic
duty. Further, certain doctors have
gone out of their way to try to prove
that the use of contraceptives is contrary
to health and nature. These same people,
we may note, have no aversion from the
wearing by women of internal remedial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
rubber supports for months on end nor
to patching up with silver, papier mâché,
and other foreign materials, the insides
and outsides of human beings mutilated
in the natural and healthy pursuit called
war. I am not concerned with the morals
of convention or superstition, but with
the morals of experience. It is the experience
of modern women that sex is an
instinctive need to them as it is to men,
and further that the prevention of conception
brings to them no loss of poise,
health, or happiness. On the contrary,
when once they embark on the task of
maternity, contraception is a blessed safeguard
to health and recovery in the
periods of rest between pregnancies. I
am not going to deny that the most
perfect delight known to human beings
is the completely reckless, mutually adoring
union of two people of vitality and
intelligence who hope to create another
human being as a constant reminder of
the beauty of that moment. But many
considerations, which we shall discuss,
forbid a yearly child. I read recently
in an article by G. K. Chesterton, that
sex without gestation and parturition is
like blowing the trumpets and waving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
flags without doing any of the fighting.
From a woman such words, though displaying
inexperience, might come with
dignity; from a man they are an unforgivable,
intolerable insult. What is
man’s part in sex but a perpetual waving
of flags and blowing of trumpets and
avoidance of the fighting? The vast
majority of men are not even tender or
kindly to their pregnant or nursing wives,
nor will they give help or consideration
to the care of their young children.</p>

<p>A revolt against motherhood under
present conditions is not surprising, nor
is it entirely regrettable. There are quite
a number of women whose minds and
bodies are not fitted or have not been
fitted by their upbringing and education
to produce and care for children. This
is a source of distress to many people,
who, as was suggested earlier, did not
think of it at the right moment, when
the education of women in public and
private schools was being developed.
Even now these same people stand in
the way of the surest remedy: which is
to teach science, physiology, and the
beauty of sex and maternity to boys and
girls at an early age. The London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
County Council, many of whom are certainly
distressed beyond measure at the
falling birth-rate and the discontent and
irresponsibility of modern young people,
have just, in consultation with suitably
selected moral headmasters and mistresses,
turned down the suggestion of sex-teaching
in elementary and secondary schools.
We are always told that boys and girls
of all classes nowadays acquire this
knowledge easily for themselves, but
the mere knowledge is not the only
thing to the adolescent mind. Things
not spoken of by parents or teachers,
things dealt with in hushed voices by
moral and spiritual leaders, surrounded
by cant and humbug and false sentiment,
are bound to be thought nasty by mild
young people and to provide ribald laughter
for the obstreperous.</p>

<p>This is not to say that sex-information
should be given in a spirit of evangelical
solemnity and exhortation, nor even of
soft sentimentality. All that is needed
is lessons in physiology, taught as a
matter of course, as botany or nature-study
are often taught; and then explanations
to boys of the working of their
bodies, how to keep them in health,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
how not to dissipate and destroy their
energies too soon. Further, they should
be told that woman is neither a chattel
nor a servant, nor even an inferior, but
a partner in joy as in the business of
life; that there is no question or difficulty,
public or private, which cannot be brought
to her for discussion and judgment; and
that she has a right to share in all
decisions affecting a joint life, children,
money, and the conduct of affairs of
State. To girls in the same way could
be explained the physical changes of
puberty, marriage, and maternity, how
the child grows, what food and care the
mother, and afterwards the baby, will
need. There is nothing in this too difficult
or shocking to young or adolescent
minds. So many of us can remember
the secret conclaves with our friends
when we puzzled out and pieced together
what scraps of information we could
glean, awakening instinct darkly supplementing
this knowledge. Some of us
can remember, perhaps, having noticed
obscene writing on school-walls, instantly
reported by shocked prefects, instantly
effaced by school-mistresses with an awful
and portentous gravity which made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
us feel we had stumbled on the brink of
a secret of incredible wickedness and
horror. One straightforward lecture of
concise information could have dispelled
the lurking mystery once and for all and
imparted a sense of magic and wonder
and ambition. Some of the more fortunate
of us, through study in libraries
and dreaming over poems, created for
ourselves a finer attitude. With no
teaching other than that we might find
someone who would marry us some day,
and that marriage was an excellent destiny
even for educated women, and with no
belief in any of the moral taboos current
around us, some of us can none the less
remember the pride of caring for the
body, safeguarding health and looks,
avoiding excess, severe strain, and overwork,
because we cherished our dreams
of the children that our bodies were to
make—not ordinary children, of course
not: Promethean creatures, endowed with
every gift that mortal man could steal
from the jealous gods, strong, beautiful,
intelligent and bold—kings and conquerors,
not of their fellow-creatures but of
nature and the mystery of the world.
There is not a woman, unless completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
warped by early training, in whom such
dreams and visions will not stir if we
try to wake them. If not, then let her
pass: we do not need her to perpetuate
the race. And do not trick her into
motherhood by false sentiment and information,
or by withholding from her
the means to protect herself if she is not
fully resolved upon bearing a child.</p>

<p>We want better reasons for having
children than not knowing how to prevent
them. Nor should we represent motherhood
as something so common and easy
that everyone can go through it without
harm or suffering and rear her children
competently and well. Without arousing
dread or horror, we should tell young
women frankly the pain and agony of
childbirth, and the anxiety and griefs
which are the fate of every woman who
is a mother by choice and therefore loves
her children. Nothing whatever is to be
gained by driving the timorous and weak
by lies or compulsion into pain which
they will resent and responsibility which
they will evade. Everything is to be
gained by training a woman in knowledge,
courage, and physical strength, and
leaving it then to her own instinct and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
her mind to tell her that to create new
human beings is worth the discomfort
and the suffering which she must necessarily
undergo. Those in whom the
courage to create survives when choice is
free and all the facts are known are those
best fitted to bring children into the
world, and breed in them eagerness and
intrepidity. The others will only pass
on fear and distaste for life from which
individuals and the community suffer far
too much already.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The anti-feminists who see in emancipated
women nothing but persecuting spinsters should
take comfort from the fact that voluntary
motherhood will ultimately destroy feminism, if
they are right. The children of women passionately
desirous of maternity will inherit strong
parental and survival instincts, the occasional
feminist “sport” not reproducing herself!</p>

</div>

<p>I do not mean by this that we should,
scorning the aid of science, return to
natural childbirth, and let its pangs scare
off the weaklings and the cowards. In
this matter the charges of our critics
are conflicting. They condemn us for
having sought the aid of science to
mitigate our suffering, and in the same
breath tell us that a return to natural
child-bed will bring back a primitive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
exhilaration and freedom from pain lost
for thousands of years. I do not believe
that for any comparatively civilized race,
any race really worthy the name of man,
childbirth has ever been painless. The
upright position, held by eighteenth-century
divines to be a source of pride
in man, was the first injustice to women.
Nor do I believe that the sufferings of
modern women are any worse or their
confinements any more difficult than those
of women in the past. They are more
closely observed and the difficulties
known, and, where skill is available, the
dangerous ones are less likely to be fatal.
In the past the fragile woman died, or
continued ailing, unobserved by a doctor
and afraid to complain. People who
live and breed in a state of nature are
by no means so healthy and vigorous as
our modern Rousseaus would have us
believe: more children die than survive,
and those who are left have physical
defects and deformities which could have
been remedied by knowledge and care.
These and the ravages of smallpox and
other diseases, and the deformities due
to the natural accidents of life unmitigated
by medical care, produce far more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ugliness than the mark of an obstetric
instrument on temple or forehead. Then,
again, youth passes more quickly. The
men and women we see in modern life,
still reasonably young and fresh with
rounded faces and teeth stopped or
supplemented by art, would in a more
primitive community be dead, or
else crouching useless and despised,
toothless and with sunken cheeks
by the fireside of their sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>Decay and pain belong to nature. To
arrest the one and mitigate the other
has been the task which the sciences that
deal in physiology have set themselves.
Remedial at first, they pass on to the stage
of prevention. Already the principle of
intelligent medicine is to strengthen what
is weak in the body by nourishment and
exercise rather than provide artificial
substitutes. Paralysed limbs return to
life; women retain their teeth white and
strong through several pregnancies. This
is not done by a return to nature, but by
an increase in civilization and knowledge.
In that way our very landscapes have
been formed. We prune, we nourish
the soil, we cross-breed our plants. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
vegetables upon which the enthusiast
for nature urges us to live are the product
of science and artifice: thousands of
years of cultivation, nitrates from Chile,
skill of the experimenter, skill of the
gardener’s hand. The same is true of
the animals we breed for meat, eggs, or
milk supply. Agriculture and stock-breeding
seem natural to us—they were
not natural in the distant past. As
regards the human body, to me at least
it seems that we are now beginning to
approach the right attitude. There was
more dosing and doctoring of petty ailments
among intelligent people in the
last century. To-day we try to learn
how best to live in order that such ailments
may not occur, and substitute a
well-balanced diet for aids to digestion
and the normal functioning of our bodies.
We do the same in rearing our children.
And this attitude would become more
general if those who rule us, Press, Church,
rich men and politicians, would consider
it really important that every man,
woman, and child in the State should
have health and happiness, and therefore
supply broadcast the necessary rules of
life and sufficient of healthy and staple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
foods for all, in place of advertisement of
quack remedies and patent substitutes
prepared by profiteers.</p>

<p>To return to the application of science
and nature to maternity. A special
sentimentality and superstition inherited
from the completely savage periods of
history cling about this, as about sex.
The avoidance of suffering in childbirth
is taboo in the Japanese moral code, as
it was until recently in Christian morals.
Religion has persisted in regarding the
female body as unclean when engaged in
its most important functions, and purifying
it afterwards by special prayers to the
Deity.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We find this savagery current
in Judaism<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as in Christianity, together
with an exhortation to be fruitful and
multiply, and therefore to pass through
shame and uncleanness as often as we
can. It was thought a horror and an
outrage when chloroform was used to
help us. It is a still greater horror when
means are discovered of not having children
at all. To this day most doctors and
dentists refuse to give an anæsthetic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
draw a rotten tooth which is wearing
down a pregnant mother’s strength by
sleepless nights and days of agony. Yet
this can be done with reasonable care
and skill. Behind all this there is the
mystic belief that somehow or other nature
does the work best unaided and unhindered;
and this mysticism is rooted
in a savage taboo. Life is, indeed, so
pertinacious that somehow some of us
will survive whatever we do, but this
does not seem to me an adequate attitude
for the rational mother.</p>

</div>

<p>The truth is that it is not desired or
expected that mothers should be rational.
Maternal instinct is so wonderful, maternal
devotion so sublime, cry our sentimental
brutes. Whatever we may have known
of life and the outside world, it is still
expected in modern times that, once married,
we shall descend into a morass of
instinct and ignorance from which we
shall never, if the male and the vindictively-minded
spinster can prevent it,
emerge again. We are privileged, so we
are told, in that we may bear each year
a child for the State, rock the cradle,
wash, mend, and make, pass on the lore
of housekeeping and infant-care to our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
daughters just as we received it from our
mothers. It is such a beautiful picture:
a pity it is entirely false. The old-fashioned
mother had no lore, and her
instinct was inadequate. She succeeded
by luck rather than by knowledge. She
adored, or disciplined; she killed by kindness
or by severity and neglect. She
would coddle when she should have
hardened, harden when she should have
coddled; she would over-feed and under-feed,
or give the wrong kind of food.
Since it has been the fashion for women
to have minds, the books for mothers have
become more scientific and our intelligent
inquiries have been met by research
and more adequate replies. Every mother
with any intelligence who has reared
one or more children through the first
year of life and up to five years of
age would admit nowadays that scientific
knowledge was of more service to her
than all the instinct and adoration at her
command. Indeed, I believe the so-called
maternal instinct in handling and understanding
babies consists of habit almost
imperceptibly learnt in tending the first,
blossoming into a smooth instinctive unity
with the coming of the second. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
fashionable mother, said to be devoid of
maternal instinct because she neglects her
child, has simply not learnt it, because
necessity does not compel her to practical
duties. This is even true, though less
so, of well-to-do mothers who feed their
babies at the breast.</p>

<p>People will persist in imagining that
uncivilized women were always able to
feed their children in natural fashion.
Very often they were obliged to seek the
help of another mother, and, when that
was not forthcoming, the baby died. It
is quite true that our adaptation to modern
conditions of life, nerve-stress, combined
with overwork for women in towns
and industrial districts, has caused breast-feeding
to be less common than it was in
the past. But here again the way of
life is not back to nature, which is impossible
because we cannot at a blow
destroy industrialism and the towns—but
onwards, to greater knowledge. Instead
of bullying the mothers and telling
them it is wicked not to feed their babies
at the breast, let them know how, by
pre-natal care of health and strength,
by diet, by deliberate nerve-control,
they can feed their babies with comfort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and delight and without detriment to
their health and the work which they
must necessarily do—or even to their
beauty. Here again, if choice is free
and the child therefore ardently desired,
there is more chance of success with
breast-feeding. And knowledge of the
chemical constituents of cow’s milk and
patent foods as compared with human
milk is more likely to induce the
modern mother to suckle her child
than volumes of abuse or sentimental
twaddle.</p>

<p>Then as to the hygiene of pregnancy.
Could our mothers have taught us about
the different food-values, about protein,
nitrogenous foods, calcium from the green
foods for teeth and bones, avoidance of
too many albuminous foods? Knowledge
of what diet can do to help us in
pregnancy and our children in early youth
is in its infancy, but it is there, none
the less. Shall we fling it aside and return
to pure instinct? What massage and
remedial exercises have taught can be
applied to our bodies during pregnancy
and after childbirth. It is probable that
closer study of the functions of the
muscles of the back and the abdomen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
would enable us to teach women to exercise
and control them in a way that would
make childbirth almost painless, and the
recovery of poise and activity afterwards
more rapid and more thorough. Under
present conditions, muscles that are often
too rigid or too feeble expand and never
recover their tone; others—the back
muscles, it may be—go out of use temporarily
and similarly do not recover.
In the middle-class woman laziness is
often the cause of difficult confinements
and poor recovery of the figure; in the
working mother a too speedy return to
work which is too hard and does not
exercise the body harmoniously; in both
the ignorance which leads to wrong kinds
of nourishment during pregnancy, and
fear of doing harm to the child which
leads to rigid and over-careful movement,
are responsible for a good many troubles.
Psychological effects may be serious.
Most women develop during pregnancy
sensitiveness and a timidity protective to
the child. From this the very fertile
mother has no opportunity to recover.
Hence many of the silly old ladies who
cannot cross roads unaided by a policeman.
With birth-control, in two years a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
determined mother can completely restore
her nerve, her joy in life, and her full
muscular powers.</p>

<p>The author of <cite>Lysistrata</cite> suggests that
by diet we may produce thin babies and
therefore have easier confinements. This
may be true, but it is a curious fact that
the experience of some mothers and doctors
goes to show that much protein
(which Mr. Ludovici suggests we should
avoid) produces a thin baby and a corpulent
mother; that, on the other hand,
light and nitrogenous foods, while keeping
the mother slim and supple, yield a plump
8 to 9 lbs. baby. I think the size of our
babies is perhaps not so much under our
control as many might wish to suggest.
Heredity enters in. Children sometimes
have large fathers. The sheep-breeder
knows that he dare not mate certain
larger types of rams with small-made
ewes.</p>

<p>In all these problems, however, it is
the frankness and intelligence which
feminism has made possible for women
which will bring solution and progress,
rather than a return to the unguided
instincts of our forefathers. The lore
of motherhood is a science which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
now beginning, but it is not following
the lines which convention and the moralists
expect. It defies sentiment, ridicules
unnecessary and unintelligent sacrifice, is
not content to suffer, but makes demands.
It begins with birth control, which to
many seems the negation of motherhood,
but which to the creative mother is the
key-stone of her work.</p>

<p>Suppose we have educated our young
women sanely about physical matters,
as suggested earlier in this chapter. As
they reach the age of maturity and
activity, what will they find? If they
are middle- or upper-class, an existence
that is not too intolerable. Feminism
has won for them the right of entry to
most professions and, provided they are
fairly able, they can get work. None the
less, it must be admitted that the years
since the War have borne hardly upon
wage-earning women of all classes. The
lack of sexual freedom is a terrible burden,
but the remedy ultimately lies in their
own hands. Life in marriage still offers
reasonable comfort and good food for
man and wife and two or three children.
But late marriages, from the lack of
opportunity for men and the expense of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
living, cause girls’ young bodies to be
worn with longing unless they are bold
enough to follow our modern Aspasias.
This waiting to marry is a real danger to
young women’s health which conventional,
unimaginative people refuse to face. It
produces nervous disorders bordering at
times on insanity.</p>

<p>As regards the care of her body in
pregnancy and childbirth, and the feeding
of her children, the middle-class mother
is in a position to carry out what modern
science has to teach. She cannot have a
large family, it is true, and the cry goes
up on all sides that it is very hard for
the middle-classes to pay for the proper
education of their children.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The best
stocks are being penalized and extinguished,
so we are told. This is part of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
much bigger problem, and a problem that
involves the class-war. All ambitious
mothers, from miners’ wives to the aristocracy,
would like to breed the fine
types who receive a thorough education
and then enter one of the intellectual
professions. Obviously this cannot be.
And, given equal ability in two children
of different classes of life, there is no just
reason for driving the worker’s child,
who has less good food and conditions
and is therefore less fitted to stand the
strain, through the worry of the scholarship
system, whilst the other child’s path
is made smooth to a ruling position. Man
for man, woman for woman, the workers
would be the equals of the middle-class
in strength and ability, given the same
nourishment, comfort and training. In
actual fact, the middle-class is perpetually
being replenished in one generation,
or two at most, from below. Middle-class
fathers and mothers have no right
to claim the privilege of a large family
unless their children, if they are strong
but not clever, are prepared to work the
railways or dig coal in the mines. Professional
people, scientists, artists, research
workers, pure mathematicians, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
well as skilled engineers, are, indeed, the
salt of the earth, and the community that
fails to produce them and give them scope
is doomed in this modern world. But
they are supported by manual labor,
and it cannot be denied that their number
cannot be indefinitely extended except
by an increase of productivity and
wealth. A more equal system of society
will diminish drudgery and make it possible
for all to have a fine development
of intelligence and understanding, whatever
the work on which they are employed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> An instance of the incredible snobbery surrounding
this question is given by the decision
of the conference of Headmasters of Secondary
Schools, January, 1925, against free secondary
education. While the middle-class parent groans
against the cost of his children’s education, he
also refuses to take the obvious remedy of making
education free, for fear the working class should
get some of it. Class difficulties would not exist
if health and education were adequately dealt
with.</p>

</div>

<p>Feminism in the mother has led us
far from maternity. That is what it is
bound to do. The working mother to-day
looks straight from her kitchen, if
she is lucky enough to have one, on to
one of the most complex situations in
history. And the intelligent ones are not
blind to the situation. That is why I
suggested that, though middle-class feminism
has conquered the professions, the
feminism of working mothers might bring
a new and powerful contribution to our
work.</p>

<p>The life of the working woman who
intends maternity is becoming well-nigh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
impossible, and she knows it. When
she has found a husband the community
denies them a decent house.
Possibly they find one room or two at
an exorbitant rent, with no water and a
grate unsuited for cooking. There are
no restaurants at which the pair can
afford to feed. Therefore they exist on
partially or casually-cooked food, innutritious
bread, and food from tins.
Things may not be so bad if the wife can
go on with work at a mill and get food
that is fairly good at the canteen,
her wages helping the meals taken at
home.</p>

<p>The coming of a baby too often means a
search for another lodging. The Bishops
and the Generals like babies, but landladies
don’t. Another room is found, perhaps.
The mother works till the last moment,
has a difficult confinement and inadequate
attention, and gets up too soon.
It is not easier for her than for a delicately-nurtured
woman, and it is not less
painful. Probably it is worse, because the
working mother has from birth been underfed
and has weaknesses and deformities—a
contracted pelvis, perhaps—that a
woman well-fed and cared for escapes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Then it goes on, baby after baby up to
ten and eleven,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> always in one room and
no more money coming in. The mother
works whenever she can to help keep the
family. Frequently she is cursed or beaten
by her husband for her fertility. Should
the husband die, she must work continually
and harder or send her children to
the workhouse. In the opinion of the
Bishops, she deserves the “stigma of the
Poor Law,” and, in the opinion of all
right-thinking people, anything done for
her by individuals or the State is in the
nature of a charity.</p>

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> A woman of 45 years of age gave birth
recently at Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, Paddington,
to her 23rd child. Ten children is not uncommon.</p>

</div>

<p>If I but had the eloquence of Hecuba
mourning her slaughtered sons! The
crime of war is bad enough: this butchery
of hope and promise and human lives is
one so black that the heart and mind of
every woman who has borne a child
should revolt against it until it is tolerated
no more. It is easy to escape into
an aristocratic theory of society. It has
been done before, and ends in the guillotine.
These working mothers are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
people who must be lied to and terrified
by bogies for fear that they use their
votes to help themselves. And it is
they who, when they sit in conference,
demand of the State the right to stem the
tide of children, to endow mothers, to
pension widows, to teach and tend maternity
and ensure rest for pregnant and
nursing women; to see that houses and
schools are built, and to control and
purify the food-supply. Here is the most
serious problem for the mothers, and one
which the middle-class politician does not
touch, because for the middle-class pure
and fresh food is almost always obtainable.
It is for the working mother to
tackle those tins. She cannot now destroy
industrialism, which dragged her work and
her after it to the mill; but she can claim
her right to control it in the name of life
and the destiny of her children. Control
of the population is essential to solving
the food-problem and improving national
health. Women in small houses know it.
They know, moreover, that contraceptives
are better than infanticide and war.
The survival of the fittest is a false
doctrine in child-bearing as in fighting.
Every child which starts with a reasonably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
good constitution can, by the right
care up to one year and food up to five,
grow up to be strong and well. And, if
the weak and unhealthy are discouraged
from breeding and healthy mothers given
proper care, great improvements are
possible. Poor food and over-crowding are
the ladder down which we go to mental
deficiency and ultimate complete feebleness
of mind.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> If we cared for life, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
best food would by law go to the pregnant
and nursing mothers instead of, as at
present, to clubs for fat old gentlemen and
the frequenters of palatial hotels. It is
probable that at present we do not produce
enough milk, or produce and import
enough butter and eggs to distribute adequately
to all.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But, by stabilizing or decreasing
our population, and by co-operation,
intensive culture and control of
marketing abroad and of marketing and
purity at home, we could see to it that
everybody had enough and that what they
had was really good.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Professor MacBride, dealing recently with the
“Inheritance of Defect” (<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, January
8, 1925) said: “The question of questions
was whether the failure of the lowest strata of
society was due to their surroundings or to their
inborn characters. Such questions must be ultimately
decided by experiment; and proper experimental
work could only be done with animals;
we were not entitled to make <i lang="la">corpora vilia</i>
of our fellow human beings. For this reason he
would direct attention to the common goldfish,
whose weird monstrosities were all originally due
to the starvation of the eggs with respect to
light and air in the earliest stages of development.
The result of this starvation was to
weaken the developmental power and to produce
a disharmonious arrest of growth of various organs.
Similar arrests of growth occurred in human
beings, and were the causes of mental and
bodily defects. Their original cause, however,
must be sought in the starvation and poisoning of
the blood of the mother, but, once started, they
were hereditary.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> Working people live on tinned milk, margarine,
and substitute eggs—all deficient in necessary
vitamins.</p>

</div>

<p>To feed an industrial population in a
small island is a peculiar and special
problem and one demanding expert care
and advice. Food must come long distances
and must “keep.” Hence the
preservatives and tins and the need to be
watchful beyond measure against poisoning
and the loss of what is vital to our
well-being. With research, the problem
would be easy; but we must make it
clear that it is important. Science would
easily enable us to produce more from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
soil, and, as regards the food of mothers,
since the assimilation of extra minerals,
salts, etc., in their natural state is not
always satisfactory or easy during pregnancy,
we might find ways of growing
food, through treatment of the soil, to
provide for the special needs of their condition.</p>

<p>What then must feminist mothers
demand? The right first of all to the
recognition of their work—the most dangerous
of all trades and the most neglected
and despised. They should ask for endowment
from the community. This is
opposed by many on the ground that fathers
delight to support their children, and
it is they who should claim from the
community an adequate family-wage. But,
after all, it is the mother who bears and
tends the child, and, although many women
receive the whole of their husbands’
wages, others must fight a humiliating
battle against drink and tobacco for the
wherewithal to build their children’s
bodies. This struggle is exemplified on a
large scale in the spending of State revenue,
most of which goes on armaments
and the forces of destruction, and an infinitesimal
portion to aid and support life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
If Jason cannot give up his murderous
playthings, let him have neither sons to
destroy nor daughters to drag through
misery. His children shall never be conceived.
I have indicated that this is happening
already, not as a deliberate revolt,
but as a counsel of despair in a world
which offers no hope, no joy, and no opportunity
to the young.</p>

<p>The mother has a right to demand two
years’ rest between pregnancies; and
the right to decide the number of her
children. For some the call of motherhood
is insistent and its charm grows with
experience; they would be good mothers
and might well have large families. They
could help others by superintending
nursery-schools in which children from
one to five years might have their important
meal of the day. But it is imperative
that the woman who has children should
not be shut out from public life. The
ideal would be for a woman to continue
her education at least till eighteen, have
the first child at twenty-four, then perhaps
three others at two-year intervals.
This assumes that large numbers of
women do not choose to breed. At thirty-five
every mother of four children would,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
in a community of good schools, convenient
houses, and well-run restaurants,
be free again to take part in public life.
It does not follow that she would be separated
from her children; they would go
to day-schools. But the mother would do
the work for which she was best fitted in
school,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> kitchen, hospital, shop, mill, or
Parliament. In this way her opinion would
count, and her attitude to life help to
permeate the community, which is otherwise
left to be guided by the outlook of
the single woman and the male. Problems
of unemployment and competition due to
married women’s work are really questions
of population pressure, muddled thinking,
and bad organization. To discuss all this
in close detail is hardly within the scope
of this book.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> I am strongly of opinion that experience of
maternity, even more than of marriage alone,
would help the teacher. Some women, even teachers,
are bored by children until they have one of
their own, whereupon all children of all ages become
interesting.</p>

</div>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said that the
community should never, except on the
strongest grounds, deny parenthood to
man or woman. Therefore marriages
which after two years did not result in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
child should be dissoluble at the wish of
either party to the contract. This, apart
from all other reasons for which the cancelling
of marriage should be allowed.
Partnership in marriage should in effect be
regarded as a partnership for parenthood,
and as such should not be entered upon
lightly.</p>

<p>Before we pass on to an attempt at a
summary and conclusion of the argument,
it may be as well to re-state briefly what
is the matter with men. Certainly they
are not such fierce tyrants as when first
we fought them; certainly they have
some grounds to complain of the feminine
arrogance which, not content with proving
equality, wants to go on and prove
women the superior sex. We might, on
grounds of science perhaps, advance this
claim, urging that, since a female being
needs one more chromosome for its
creation than a male, it must, therefore,
be of higher importance. Should we do
so, and seek to live alone on the planet,
producing our children by parthenogenesis,
our pride would be doomed to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
fall. Such children, there is reason to
believe, would all be males. At least,
that is what happens when the experiment
is tried by sea-urchins. Men, on
the other hand, like to pretend that our
assumption of intelligence and independence
is but a momentary spurt in a race
which must end in masculine victory and
feminine submission. They admit that
the great development of our freedom in
body and mind has given us a serious
advantage, and the more discerning among
them urge their fellows to press on and
catch us up. Others trundle the golden
apples beseechingly, but still Atalanta
runs.</p>

<p>I believe it to be true that the education
and outlook of men is more old-fashioned
than that of women reared in the freedom
of feminist traditions. Men have not
yet realized how women’s outlook is
changing, nor attempted very seriously
to adapt themselves to the change. They
will do so, of a certainty; for, true as it
may be that above all desires in woman
is that to be pleasing to men, it is still
truer that the desire of desires in man is
to be pleasing to women. I believe that
Puritanism or asceticism, of which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
accuse us, is very strong in them. One
of the compliments or insults that has
been hurled during the sex-war is that
the feminine mind is pervaded by the
physical harmony of the feminine body.
One may perhaps retort that the dualism
of mind and matter is a very masculine
philosophy; and one which, moreover,
men have translated into their everyday
lives by the sharp division they like to
make between fighters and thinkers,
games-playing idiots and thin intellectuals.
Too often a woman of vitality and intelligence
must choose between a soldier-gentleman
and Chaucer’s clerk.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Should
she choose the former, she takes a plunge
into the past. This man exults in murder,
whether of animals or of his fellow-creatures;
deep down within him he is
still convinced that women are divided
into good and bad—and both require the
handling of a master. His wife must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
beware how she responds to his advances;
she may be thought forward or impure.
Decency must above all things be preserved.
Though games and the classics
may have taught the English gentleman
the beauty of paganism and the joy of the
naked body where man is concerned, he
is still stuffy in his approach to sex. He
rarely brings the freshness of the morning
and the joy of the open skies to the love
of mistress or of wife. Plush, gilt and
silk stockings express the one; pipe, the
armchair at the fireside, dinner, and a
coldly furnished bedroom, the other. Conversation
is a masculine monologue, punctuated
by assent. He will be good to his
children, provided they are not odd, and
will protect his wife. He will never lift
her to rapture. She fears, and will probably
deceive him.</p>

<p>The intellectual—perhaps by reason of
the monastic tradition of learning, perhaps
because he finds Jason so revolting—does
all that he can to forget the needs
of the body. Woman counts as one of
them. She is a burden, a responsibility,
a distraction, an incursion of the material
into a world of contemplation. As for
children and domestic life, they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
make an end to all thought, to all art.
An instinctive life—so he thinks—is
possible only in spasm, if at all, for a
man with serious mental work to accomplish.
If woman persists in keeping him
company, then she must shoulder the
burdens, tend him and care for him, and
leave him alone when he doesn’t want
her. It is this contempt for the natural
play of instinct which eats the heart out
of life for many intellectuals, men and
women, of to-day. They dread the gift
of themselves, the loss of independence
which passion would bring, and therefore
they never give freely. In part, they are
cherishing the medieval tradition that to
be worthy of spiritual or mental labour
man and woman must go aside and renounce;
in part, they are inspired by a
tight conception of materialism, in which
individuals are hurled like lumps of matter
by dynamic forces through space, unable
to do more than come near, but
never mingle one with another. This
view of life and the medieval are combining
to destroy our world in lovelessness
and despair.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned mind clings to
spiritual duties and consolations and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
framework of Church discipline, as a
bulwark against personal licence; the
more modern mind is dominated by
mechanism—which is, after all, no more
than the rational control of matter—and
seeks in an intelligent organization
of the State, a framework within which
each individual is to perform the duties
for which he is best fitted. To neither
conception is love between individuals, or
sex-love between man and woman,
important. In effect, personal relationships
do not matter. The Christian
doctrine of all-embracing love was once
potent, but fails to-day because of the
foundation of God, dogma, and Church
on which it is built and which modern
people cannot accept. “To love thy
neighbour as thyself” is also inadequate
without knowledge and understanding.
But the rational materialists’ attitude—such,
for instance, is that of the Bolsheviks—to
human relationships, in particular
to women and sex, is as lacking
in the sense of human dignity as the
Christian. Monogamy and undiscriminating
licence rest upon a common basis
of contempt for love and personality,
both asserting that the desire of a man is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
for a woman, of a woman for a man, but
no matter whom. Dualism, as ever, is
the culprit. Sex-love is to be no more
than a physical need—no part of the
serious business of life. Science has
brought a more modern attitude to
matter which by its effect upon the
imagination may change our conception
of personality and sex. Force, struggle,
solidity, contact, may yield to gentleness,
non-resistance, intermingling and uniting—not
by an ethical change, but by a
change in scientific thought. We shall no
longer think of mind and matter as
wronging or thwarting one another, because
they are not different forces; and
we shall no longer be able to separate
physical from mental virtue or depravity.
We shall no longer value a love that
suppresses or disregards the union of personality.</p>

<p>Taboos and superstitions, struggling
dynamic individuals or States—how
may we set up a new vision? Perhaps
what I have written above seems far-fetched
to the reader, but I do not think
our life can be cut up into compartments.
Philosophy and sex are more important
in politics than General Elections. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
revolt against the all-powerful Christian
State began in the assertion of certain
people that their love of good fruit and
wine or their enjoyment of sex were not
worthy of hell-fire. On personal conduct,
on our standards of personal relationship,
man to woman, parents to children,
are built the customs and laws of States
and ultimately their national and international
policy. It is here, then, with
man and woman, that we must begin. I
have in mind, as I write, a piece of Chinese
porcelain, on which the sage or poet
sits with his book and long pipe; a lovely
and elegant lady peeps over his shoulder,
and close at hand plays an impish child.
I do not think that the Chinese who conceived
it expected that poet to write bad
verses, or, if a sage, to compose worthless
philosophy. On the contrary, to love with
devotion, to be learned, to have children,
are ideas which have shaped the harmony
of Chinese life. As compared with their
generous acceptance of instinct our Christian
dread of sex and horror of the body
are obscene.</p>

<p>If we are to make peace between man
and woman, and by their unity and partnership
change the ideas that govern our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
politics and our outlook on the world, it
is essential that men should make a more
determined attempt to understand what
feminists are seeking. It is useless to go
on abusing, or pretending that this is a
matter of minor importance. It is essential
also that women should think clearly
and continue in courage and honesty of
word and action, neither abandoning all
for the pursuit of pleasure nor glorying in
opportunities for an oppressive morality
belonging to past ages. First and foremost,
man or woman, we are human beings.
There is a great deal of the work in the
community which we can each do with
equal ability, given equal training and opportunity.
There are other tasks which
we must agree to delegate to one another,
and neither despise the other for performing
them. Life and harmony, generosity
and peace are the ideals which the best
thought of feminism has set before us.
We believe that States and individuals can
put them into practice. Will man not
pause to understand before he continues
on the path of destruction and strife, cupidity
and war? Can we not persuade
Jason from barbarity and Admetus to the
abandonment of his fears? To live with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
vigour, body and mind and imagination,
without fear or shame or dread of death;
to drive these baser passions from the
hold they have upon our morality and
our politics—this is what we ask of modern
men and women. They can come to it
only in a reckless love of one another, a
passion that gives again and again without
fear of hurt or exhaustion. It is not an
abandonment to nature and to instinct
that we need. Pure and barbaric instinct
is no more. Our bodies are too much
impregnated by inherited habit and knowledge,
too much surrounded in their growth
by the findings of science. Men and
women are not creatures of clay, nor disembodied
spirits; but things of fire intertwining
in understanding, torrents leaping
to join in a cascade of mutual ecstacy.
There is nothing in life to compare with
this uniting of minds and bodies in men
and women who have laid aside hostility
and fear and seek in love the fullest understanding
of themselves and of the universe.
You cannot measure it in inches,
nor turn it on and off like a tap. You
cannot stay it now and indulge it another
time. You cannot come to it by religion
or by unaided reason, or by the brute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
courage of sheer physical vitality. Jealousy
is death. Dualism is nonsense, compartments
unavailing. You must have in
you the thought that is creation; life’s
spring, and the daring of its unconquered
waters—so may you transform the world
and people it with gods who know no
more the hates and littleness of men.</p>
